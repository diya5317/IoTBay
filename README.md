# IoTBay

The Internet of Things store (IoTBay) is a small company based in Sydney, Australia. 
IoTBay wants to develop an online IoT devices ordering application to allow their customers to purchase IoT devices (e.g. sensors, actuators, gateways). 

The project brief discusses the objectives and current IoTBay device collection management, order management, payment processing, delivery, user registration, login and logout features of the web application. 

This online application will help IoTBay to achieve the following objectives:

1.	Improve devices inventory management (sale, restocking)
2.	Improve customer experience (accounts, purchase, payment, shipment)
3.	Enhance sales via online search & ordering
4.	Improve staff management experience (accounts, database, inventory)


###Project Scope

The online application will allow the users (staff and customers) to register and login into the application using their user id (email) and password.

Once logged in, the authorized IoTBay staff users can manage the devices collection, track customer orders, and manage users (e.g. create, list, view, update, activate and deactivate records) and application access logs.

The customer users can browser, search, order, track their orders, manage their accounts, view history logs, save payments and shipments details.

The online application will allow anonymous users (none-registered) to browse, search, purchase and track their orders.
